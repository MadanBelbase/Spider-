## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a low-cost autonomous robotic platform capable of operating in dynamic environments while collecting environmental data and responding to potential hazards.

The system is designed to:

- Perform autonomous navigation across different locations  
- Detect environmental risks such as smoke, temperature variation, and light changes  
- Avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensing  
- Demonstrate real-time embedded control and decision-making  

This project demonstrates the practical application of embedded systems, robotics, and automation in safety and emergency-response scenarios.

## System Overview

The robot operates using a feedback-based control mechanism in which sensor inputs are continuously monitored and evaluated against predefined thresholds. The ESP32 microcontroller processes real-time data and determines appropriate movement or response actions. Servo motors execute the control decisions, enabling adaptive navigation and hazard response.

This closed-loop architecture allows the system to function reliably in dynamic environments.
