# 🕷️ SPIDER: THE AETHER  
### Autonomous Disaster-Response & Environmental Monitoring Robot

SPIDER: THE AETHER is an **ESP32-based autonomous robotic system** designed to navigate hazardous and inaccessible environments, perform real-time environmental sensing, and assist in **search, assessment, and emergency response operations**.
One Smoke Sensor - Air quality monitoring

##  Project Overview

Traditional safety and monitoring systems are limited to fixed locations and cannot operate in dangerous or inaccessible areas.  
**SPIDER: THE AETHER** overcomes this limitation by acting as a **mobile sensing platform** capable of autonomous navigation and environmental monitoring.

The robot continuously monitors:
- Smoke / gas
- Temperature & humidity
- Light intensity
- Obstacles (front & rear)

This reduces human exposure to dangerous environments and enables faster hazard detection.
